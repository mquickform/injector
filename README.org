* Injector (a cross-platform injection library used by Cube)

Injector is a haXe injection library loosely based on the SwiftSuspenders injection library used by RobotLegs.

** Using Injector

The Injector provides a means to inject an existing instance, a new instance or a singleton into a variable flagged with the @Inject meta tag: -

injector.mapInstance( MyType, someObject );
injector.mapClass( MyType, SomeClass );
injector.mapSingleton( MyType, SomeSingleton );

Injection then occurs from a manual invocation: -

Injector.inject( myInstance );

In myInstance, there will then need to be class level properties that have the @Inject meta, such as: -

@Inject public var myVar : MyType;
